Just Say Hey Chrome Extension – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2/01/2026

Overview

The Just Say Hey Chrome Extension is a user-initiated tool that allows people to share events they discover on the web into the Just Say Hey platform. We are committed to respecting user privacy and minimising data collection.

This extension does not track browsing activity, run in the background without user action, or collect personal data beyond what is required to perform its core function.

Information We Collect
1. Event Information (User-Initiated)

When a user chooses to share an event using the extension, the extension may temporarily access information from the webpage the user is viewing, such as:

Event title

Date and time

Location

Description

Event URL

This information is used only to prefill an event submission to the Just Say Hey platform and is shared only when the user confirms submission.

2. Account Information (If Signed In)

If the user chooses to sign in to their Just Say Hey account, the extension may associate submitted events with that account. Authentication is handled securely and is used only to enable publishing functionality.

The extension does not access contacts, emails, browsing history, or unrelated personal data.

3. Local Storage

The extension may store limited data locally in the user’s browser, such as:

Extension preferences

Temporary draft event data

This data is stored locally using Chrome’s storage APIs and is not used for tracking or analytics.

Information We Do Not Collect

We do not:

Track browsing history

Monitor websites visited

Collect analytics on user behaviour outside the extension flow

Run background scraping or automated data collection

Sell or share user data with third parties for advertising purposes

How Information Is Used

Information collected by the extension is used solely to:

Allow users to share events into the Just Say Hey platform

Prefill event submission forms to reduce manual entry

Associate submissions with the correct user account (if signed in)

Data Sharing

Event information is sent only to Just Say Hey’s backend services when the user explicitly submits an event. We do not share extension data with third parties outside of operating the Just Say Hey platform.

Security

All communication between the extension and Just Say Hey services is transmitted securely. No executable code is downloaded or run from external sources.

User Control

The extension only runs when the user activates it.

Access to webpage content is temporary and limited to the active tab.

Users can uninstall the extension at any time to remove all locally stored data.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
